## üöÄ Quick Start (Beginner-Friendly)

**Perfect for:** Students, researchers, data scientists, or anyone who wants to save Reddit content without technical complexity.

### What You'll Need
- A computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- 5 minutes to set up
- No coding experience required!

### Step 1: Install Python
Python is a programming language that powers this tool. Don't worry - you won't need to write any code!

1. Go to [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download Python 3.6 or newer (the website will recommend the best version for your computer)
3. Run the installer and follow the prompts
4. ‚úÖ **Test it worked:** Open your terminal/command prompt and type `python3 --version`. You should see something like "Python 3.x.x"

### Step 2: Download This Tool
1. Go to the [latest release page](https://github.com/chauduyphanvu/reddit-markdown/releases)
2. Click "Source code (zip)" to download
3. Unzip the file to a folder you'll remember (like your Desktop or Documents)

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
These are helper libraries the tool needs to work with Reddit.

1. Open your terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to the folder where you unzipped the tool
3. Run this command: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

### Step 4: Run the Tool
1. In your terminal, type: `python3 python/main.py`
2. The tool will ask you for:
   - **Reddit post URL(s)**: Copy and paste the link from your browser (like `https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/abc123/`)
   - **Where to save**: Press Enter to save in the current folder, or type a path like `/Users/yourname/Documents/reddit-posts/`
3. Wait for the magic to happen! ‚ú®

### Special Input Options

Instead of URLs, you can try these fun options:

- `demo` - Downloads a sample post to test the tool
- `surprise` - Gets a random popular post
- `r/subredditname` - Downloads trending posts from a specific subreddit (e.g., `r/science`)

### What You'll Get

After running the tool, you'll have beautiful Markdown files containing:
- The original post title and content
- All comments and replies (organized by reply depth)
- Upvote counts and timestamps
- Clean formatting that's easy to read

You can open these files in any text editor, import them into note-taking apps like Obsidian or Notion, or just read them as-is!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Mode

**Perfect for:** Power users, developers, researchers doing bulk operations, or anyone wanting to customize the experience.

### Authentication (Recommended for Heavy Use)

If you plan to download many posts, set up Reddit authentication to avoid rate limits:

1. **Create a Reddit App:**
   - Go to [reddit.com/prefs/apps](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps)
   - Click "create an app"
   - Name: `reddit-markdown` (or anything you like)
   - Type: `script`
   - Redirect URI: `http://localhost:8080` (required but unused)

2. **Configure authentication:**
   - Copy the `.env.template` file to `.env`:
     ```bash
     cp .env.template .env
     ```
   - Open `.env` in a text editor
   - Replace the placeholder values with your app's credentials:
     ```
     REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
     REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
     ```
   - In `settings.json`, set `"login_on_startup": true` in the auth section
   - **Important:** Never share your `.env` file - it contains your credentials!

### Command Line Arguments

Skip the interactive prompts and run everything from the command line:

```bash
# Download specific posts
python3 python/main.py --urls "https://reddit.com/r/science/comments/abc123,https://reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/def456"

# Download trending posts from subreddits
python3 python/main.py --subs "r/MachineLearning,r/datascience,r/Python"

# Download from multireddit collections (see settings.json)
python3 python/main.py --multis "m/tech,m/science"

# Load URLs from files
python3 python/main.py --src-files "my-urls.txt,more-urls.csv"
```

### Customization Options

Edit `settings.json` to control behavior:

| Setting | What It Does | Example Values |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| `file_format` | Output format | `"md"` or `"html"` |
| `reply_depth_max` | How deep to save comment threads | `3` (saves 3 levels deep), `-1` (all levels) |
| `show_upvotes` | Include upvote counts | `true` or `false` |
| `save_posts_by_subreddits` | Organize files by subreddit folders | `true` or `false` |

| `show_timestamp` | Include post timestamps | `true` or `false` |
| `overwrite_existing_file` | Overwrite existing files | `true` or `false` |

### Filtering Options

Control which comments get saved:

```json
"filters": {
  "keywords": ["spam", "deleted"],
  "min_upvotes": 5,
  "authors": ["AutoModerator"],
  "regexes": ["^\\[removed\\]$"]
}
```

### Automation

Run the tool automatically using GitHub Actions, cron jobs, or task schedulers. Here's a sample GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml

jobs:
  archive:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.9'
    - run: |
        pip3 install -r requirements.txt
        python3 python/main.py --subs "r/MachineLearning,r/datascience"
```

### File Organization

Enable timestamped directories to organize posts by date:

```
