# Additional dependencies for scheduler optimizations
# Install with: pip install -r requirements_scheduler_optimizations.txt

# System monitoring and resource management
psutil>=5.9.0           # Process and system utilities for monitoring CPU, memory usage
                        # Used for resource monitoring, memory tracking, and performance metrics

# Testing framework for optimization tests
pytest>=7.0.0           # Testing framework
pytest-asyncio>=0.21.0  # Async testing support
pytest-mock>=3.10.0     # Mock support for testing
pytest-cov>=4.0.0       # Coverage reporting

# Optional: For enhanced performance profiling
memory-profiler>=0.60.0 # Memory profiling (optional)
line-profiler>=4.0.0    # Line-by-line profiling (optional)

# Note: All other dependencies are already covered by the existing requirements
# The optimizations primarily use standard library modules:
# - threading, concurrent.futures (for concurrency)
# - sqlite3 (for database operations) 
# - hashlib (for bloom filter hashing)
# - signal (for graceful shutdown)
# - contextlib (for resource management)
# - queue (for connection pooling)
# - time, datetime (for timing and scheduling)
# - pathlib, tempfile (for file operations)
